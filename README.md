# Python-Spell-Checker-Autocorrection-Project

# Overview
This project utilizes various Python libraries to implement spell checking and autocorrection functionalities. It demonstrates how to correct misspelled words in sentences, check spelling within lists, and utilize autocorrect capabilities.

# Features
  - **Spell Checking** : Corrects individual misspelled words using TextBlob and autocorrect libraries.
  - **List Spell Check** : Checks and suggests corrections for misspelled words within lists using SpellChecker.
  - **Autocorrection** : Implements autocorrection of words using the autocorrect library.
  - **Sentence Correction** : Corrects entire sentences for spelling errors and prints the corrected sentence.
